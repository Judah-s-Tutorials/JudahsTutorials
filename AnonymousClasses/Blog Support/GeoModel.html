<u>class GeoModel</u><br>
An instance of this class
encapsulates a model of a rectangular area.
The model typically evolves over time
but it can be temporarly frozen,
during which time it doesn't change.
It has many methods to get and set properties,
among them:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span style="font-family: monospace;">
            public double force( Point point )<br>
            public double stress( Point point )<br>
            public double velocity( Point point )<br>
            public double acceleration( Point point )<br>
        </span>
        Returns the value of the named property
        at the given point.<br>&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <span style="font-family: monospace;">
            public double force()<br>
            public double stress()<br>
            public double velocity()<br>
            public double acceleration()<br>
        </span>
        Returns the value of the named property
        averaged over all points.<br>&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <span style="font-family: monospace;">
            public void setForce( Point point )<br>
            public void setStress( Point point )<br>
            public void setVelocity( Point point )<br>
            public void setAcceleration( Point point )<br>
        </span>
        Sets the value of the named property
        at the given point.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Important:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        For the purpose of testing,
        the model must be frozen
        before attempting to get or set a property.
    </li>
    <li>
        For the purpose of testing,
        a frozen model
        must not be frozen a second time.
    </li>
    <li>
        For the purpose of testing,
        an unfrozen model
        must not be unfrozen a second time.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <u>class ModelMonitor</u><br>
    This class is used during testing only.
    It maintains a GeoModel as an instance variable:<br>
    <span style="font-family:monospace;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private GeoModel    model;<br>
    </span>
    and ensures that the model is accessed correctly.
    For example,
    each getter and setter in the model
    is reflected by a corresponding getter/setter
    in the ModelMonitor.
    When the unit test class needs to get the velocity
    of the model at a given point,
    it calls <em>getStress(Point)</em> in the monitor;
    the monitor makes sure that the model is frozen
    prior to getting the property from the model,
    and, if necessary, restores the state of model
    after the operation completes.
