<strong>
    Working with Java I/O Streams
</strong>
</p>
<p>
In case you’re unfamiliar with I/O in Java, reading data always begins with a raw stream of bytes from a source. The source can be anything capable of producing said stream, such as a file, a web page, your keyboard, or an array of bytes. In line XX of <em>IPCDemo2Parent</em>, we establish an <em>InputStream</em>, which encapsulates the raw stream of bytes issuing from the child process’s <em>stdout</em>. If we want to treat the <em>InputStream</em> as a stream of characters, we need a more sophisticated device; in Java, input streams of characters are encapsulated in <em>Readers</em>, so at line XX, we transform the <em>InputStream</em> into an <em>InputReader</em>. <em>InputReaders</em> are still primitive and incapable of performing things such as buffering and interpreting line-endings, so at line XX, we transform the <em>InputReader</em> into a <em>BufferedReader</em>, which can distinguish between individual lines in a stream of characters. For more information about I/O stream-handling in Java, see
